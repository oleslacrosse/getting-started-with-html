    <h1>David's Notes</h1>
<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>If I want to check out <a href="www.cnn.com">my favorite site</a>, I 
would first have to type the site name in the search bar. My  <b>browser</b> 
will then make a request via the <b>internet</b> using a simple <b>http protocol</b> 
which allows it to communicate with servers. <b>Servers</b> <em> are computers that 
host files that make up the web</em>. These
files are written in a language called
<b>HTML</b> which stands for <em>hypertext markup language</em>. 
Once the server has recieved the browers' request, the servers will 
respond with files that the brower can interpret and display to end user.

<b>HTML</b>
<p><b>HTML documents</b> are coded webpages that contain text content (what you see),
references to other documents (images and video), and/or links to other pages. 
These documents are created using <b>HTML markup tags</b>. Some of the most common
tags
are written with a start tag, and ending tag, and content in between.
Tags that don't contain content are called <b>void tags</b>.

<h3>Inline vs. Block Elements</h3>
Inline and block elements are terms that explain why there 
are different ways of making new lines. 
<b>Inline elements</b> end the line whereever tag is written and wraps any
additional text to the next line. On the other hand, <b>block elements</b> create 
an invisible box around text that falls between the start and end tags. The paragraph
tag is a 
great example of a block element. Check out <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/vie

block elements.

<h4>Computers are Stupid
</h4>
<p>Computers follow 
the instructions the programmer wrote; one small error can disable an entire program
therefore, <em>it is imperative that programmers 
write exactly the way a computer understands.</em><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!
